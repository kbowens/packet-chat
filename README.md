# Packet-Chat: Real time traffic analysis

### Build information:

To build on windows, you will need to have WinPcap installed and the WinPcap dev kit Lib folder on your system LIB environment variable.


## Regarding ASU Honors Contracts

Jed and I have decided to provide Honors Contracts projects for CSE 365. However, due to the sheer number of students in this class, we (or the TAs) will not be able to provide support on *any* questions or problems related to Honors Contract projects. If you want to pursue an Honors Contract as part of CSE 365, you must choose one of the following projects:


- Reproducing an existing Linux/FreeBSD *kernel* vulnerability for which no public proof-of-concept exploit is available. You must discuss with Fish regading the vulnerability you choose. You will be required to submit your exploit and a detailed report.

- Reproducing an existing Windows *kernel* vulnerability for which no public proof-of-concept exploit is available. You must discuss with Fish regarding the vulnerability you choose. You will be required to submit your exploit and a detailed report.

- Developing a traffic analysis framework that has at least the following features: Traffic capturing; Flag detection; Keyword-based indexing and searching. You may reuse existing tools, such as tcpdump, wireshark, ElasticSearch, etc. You are not allowed to use (any parts of) existing traffic analysis frameworks. You will be required to submit the source code of your framework. Additionally, you are encouraged to use this framework during in-class Attack/Defense CTFs.

- Developing a binary-level taint tracking tool *on top of angr, Pin, Valgrind, Qemu, DynamoRIO, or Triton* that has at least the following features: Specifying tainted sources (on stack or from syscalls' output); Tracking taints that are propagated between registers and memory cells. You are not allowed to use (any parts of) existing taint-tracking frameworks. You will be required to submit the source code of your tool. Additionally, you are encouraged to use this tool during in-class CTFs.


Hacking is about sharing. Upon successful completion of your Honors Contract, all of your creations and submissions will be made public to the entire world under a permissive open-source license (e.g., BSD 2-clause), unless forbidden by law.

These projects are difficult, and they can easily waste weeks of your precious time. If you are interested, please discuss with Fish before committing to any of the above ideas. Again, professors and TAs of this course are unable to provide any technical support on these projects. Please pursue Honors Contracts with other classes if you are looking for easy projects.
